In this project, users can create and review campgrounds, benefiting from full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both campgrounds and reviews. The system enforces user authentication, ensuring that only logged-in users can add new campgrounds or edit existing ones. Moreover, authorization controls are in place, preventing users from editing campgrounds or deleting reviews created by other users.
